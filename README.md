# ProjectLockdown
Project Lockdown (an initiative from The IO Foundation) is a civic tech, interactive platform providing an overview of the state of Human and  Digital Rights around the globe. It evaluates policies obtained from high quality sources that may impact their observance. It provides, among other tools, a layered map interface that allows for a visual representation of the policies adopted, assisting a broad range of stakeholders in understanding the global state of their Rights. This empowers them to become active agents of global change.

# What does this Module do?

The funnels are responsible for channeling the data collected by Project Lockdown in a number of different ways:
- Insourcing: The data is generated by Project Lockdown's Team Research.
- Crowdsurcing: The data is generated by citizens outside of Project Lockdown.
- Machine Learning: The data is generated through Natural Language Processing algorithms. 
- Direct Feed: Public Authorities and equivalent bodies that generate policies can upload the ppolicy data directly to the database.
